The files in this directory support the compilation of the CUDA enabled version
of Scalpel. This build has several requirements: 

The current implementation makes of some functionality that requires an NVIDIA 
card of compute capability 1.2 (or greater).

The CUDA video driver and tooolkit must be installed.

The cutil.h header file must be in /usr/include (or otherwise discoverableable 
by the g++ invocation in build.sh).

In order to compile with the GPU-based code, you must #define GPU_THREADING and
undefine MULTICORE_THREADING in scalpel.h.

Assuming the above, you should be able to build the executable by running the
"build.sh" file in this directory. It will produce an executable named
scalpel-gpu. This executable functions identically to the standard scalpel build
except that it will offload header / footer searches to the GPU. Note that regex
based headers and footers are not supported by the GPU release.
